## Brain CT Scan Classification using Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning models to classify brain CT scans based on the Kaggle ‘Computed Tomography (CT) of the Brain’ dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/trainingdatapro/computed-tomography-ct-of-the-brain). The goal is to explore different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and transfer learning techniques to achieve high classification accuracy.

**Includes:**
- Outlier Detection (using PCA)
- One-Hot Encoding
- CNN Models (with varying layers + features)
- Transfer Learning Model (using pre-trained VGG-16 model)
